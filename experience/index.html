        <text class="CardTitle">Finding a cost-effective natural treatment for diabetes mellitus</text>
        <br><br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Inspiration</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease afflicting 1 in 9 adults in Singapore.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Medical expenses often amount to nearly $17k, an exorbitant sum, especially for low to middle income families.
            Furthermore, the disease often compromises its host's ability to perform at work. For those inflicted with diabetes, making ends meet is an endless struggle.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Determined to find a cost-effective herbal treatment for the disease, I embarked on this project.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Process</p>
        <p class="CardContent">I led a team in the planning and execution of the project, systematically crafting solutions to the multitude of problems that arose.
            We tested a wide variety of easily obtainable natural herbs on model organisms, known as <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, a type of worm.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Ensuring effective communication both among team members and with external contributors, as well as efficient allocation of work
        allowed my team to complete the necessary work within a limited time frame.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Challenges and how they were overcome</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Experimental inefficiency hindering progress: Performing repeated experiments to show the same trend in every scenario
        would greatly hinder the progress of research.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Seeing as the trend was only required to confirm the validity of subsequent experiments, I restructured the experiment to prove the trend
        in a preliminary experiment, allowing us to safely exclude it from subsequent experiments.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">This greatly improved efficiency by 140%, narrowing the number of experimental setups from 24 to 10 without compromising on the
        reliability of results.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Result</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Eventually, we arrived at a clear conclusion that ginseng and turmeric are beneficial in treatment of diabetes.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">My team and I represented our institution, Hwa Chong Institution, to present this research at the
            international Science and Technology Symposium for Youth in 2022, which involved institutions from Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Our work brought the following applications:</p>
        <p class="CardContent">1. Our conclusions gave diabetes patients insight regarding how they can treat their disease cost-effectively.</p>
        <p class="CardContent" id="monkey">2. Our procedures acted as a template for further research in this area.</p>

        <text class="CardTitle">Helping residents afflicted with attacks by monkeys</text>
        <br><br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Inspiration</p>
        <p class="CardContent">In 2017, I learnt of the challenges faced by those who live near nature reserves that are home to troops of monkeys,
            like being attacked for food or having their kitchens raided.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">I sympathised with the victims of the attacks and believed it important to find out the root cause behind
            the monkeysâ€™ aggressive and invasive behaviour, in order to find a way to stop them.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Process</p>
        <p class="CardContent">I conducted field studies and analysed the behaviour of the monkeys, as well as their reaction to various stimuli from humans.
            The insight gained from the research allowed me to determine how the residents should behave around monkeys to avoid unnecessary conflict.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Challenges and how they were overcome</p>
        <br>
        <p class="CardSubheader">Result</p>
        <p class="CardContent">Eventually I concluded that monkeys were conditioned to associate humans with food, and mount an attack in lack thereof,
            was caused primarily by intentional feeding of monkeys. As for non food-related attacks, they are typically induced by provocative behaviour around the monkeys.
            Some methods of reconditioning the monkeys include hiding away food-containing plastic bags,
            not feeding them and taking measures to avoid aggression like avoiding eye contact and recognising signs of the animalsâ€™ anger.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">I was invited to present this research at the Roots & Shoots conference organised by the Jane Goodall Institute,
        where I had the opportunity to share my findings with affected residents.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">My research brought the following applications:</p>
        <p class="CardContent">1. The observations made revealed the true cause of the aggression observed in the monkeys.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">2. The conclusions made would enable residents and monkeys to coexist in harmony, greatly benefitting both parties.</p>

        <p class="CardSubheader">Roles & contributions</p>
        <p class="CardContent">As part of my primary appointment, I was responsible for creating training plans and ensuring their smooth execution.
            To improve the efficiency of operation, I decided to create blank templates for each document with the correct formatting implemented.
        Not only did this make the creation of plans more efficient for my department, it also served as a way for my successors to minimise errors in their paperwork.</p>
        <p class="CardContent">As part of my secondary appointment, I was responsible for ensuring the wellbeing of the Secondary 4 training squad.
        After observation on the ground as well as consultation, I decided that the conditions in their existing training location were suboptimal,
        due to lack of ventilation and infestation of mosquitoes. Thus, I assessed the viability of other training locations, and communicated with other organisations
        to ensure that the locations were available for use. I then convinced the officers in charge of the need for a change and managed to push through.</p>
